;; TODO: Implement the following two functions.
;;
;; parse should take an s-expression representing a program and return an
;; AST corresponding to the program.
;;
;; eval-base should take an expression e (i.e. an AST) and evaluate e,
;; returning the resulting value.
;;

;; See ps3-ast.rkt and README.md for more information.

;; Note that as in lecture 6, you probably want to implement a version
;; of eval that returns a result that can be an arbitrary value (not just
;; a BaseValue) and also returns a store.  Your eval-base would then be a
;; wrapper around this more general eval that tries to conver the value
;; to a BaseValue, and fails if it cannot be.
;;
;; For grading, the test cases all result in values that can be converted to base values.
